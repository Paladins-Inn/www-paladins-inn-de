<p>The <strong>Imperial Dossier</strong> series examines in-depth the main factions of the <strong>Fading Suns</strong> universe. Each book serves as a primer on a single faction, commissioned by the empire for its diplomats, bureaucrats, soldiers, star-sailors, Questing Knights, and their ohorts, with commentary from the Imperial Eye. Each book also includes a "factbook" about a topic closely related to the dossier's faction, and a rules section that includes new callings, perks, equipment, and event alien creatures.</p>
