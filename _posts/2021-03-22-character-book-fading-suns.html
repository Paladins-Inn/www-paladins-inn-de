<p>It is the sixth millennium. Humanity spread accross the stars and build a republic of advanced technology and universal emancipation -- and then squandered it, fought over it, and lost it. As the light of the stars began to slowly fade, a New Dark Age descended upon the Known Worlds. Them, from the ashes of war and ruin, Emperor Alexius rose to power and ushered in a new era of hope. He calls now for brave knights, wise priests, and resourcefil guilders to bring his peace to all the worlds, known and unknown.</p>
