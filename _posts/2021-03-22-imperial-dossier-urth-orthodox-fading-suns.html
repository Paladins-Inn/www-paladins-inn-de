excerpt: Priests of the Orthodoxy -- from the ostentatious bishops of the capital
  cities to the humble parish priests in the most poverty-stricken fiefs -- are found
  throughout the Known Worlds. While this ruling sect of the Universal Church has
  gained a reputation for cunning pollitical maneuvers, most of its priests know little
  of such things, being entirely too busy protecting the souls of the simple faithful.
  While many may spurn the Orthodoxy for its overtly political role, when tragedy
  strikes, it is the Orthodoxy they return to for consolation.

<p>Priests of the Orthodoxy -- from the ostentatious bishops of the capital cities to the humble parish priests in the most poverty-stricken fiefs -- are found throughout the Known Worlds. While this ruling sect of the Universal Church has gained a reputation for cunning pollitical maneuvers, most of its priests know little of such things, being entirely too busy protecting the souls of the simple faithful. While many may spurn the Orthodoxy for its overtly political role, when tragedy strikes, it is the Orthodoxy they return to for consolation.</p>

<p>The <strong>Imperial Dossier</strong> series examines in-depth the main factions of the <strong>Fading Suns</strong> universe. Each book serves as a primer on a single faction, commissioned by the empire for its diplomats, bureaucrats, soldiers, star-sailors, Questing Knights, and their ohorts, with commentary from the Imperial Eye. Each book also includes a "factbook" about a topic closely related to the dossier's faction, and a rules section that includes new callings, perks, equipment, and event alien creatures.</p>
